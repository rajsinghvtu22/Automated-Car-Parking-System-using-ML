# Automated-Car-Parking-System-using-ML
In recent years, the population of the world has increased, the complexity of transportation has dramatically increased. Consequently, there is mountain traffic increase in vehicle movement, the work of mountain movement of various institutions. Vehicle parking is an important issue, and the need is increasing day by day. In India, we are still using a manual vehicle parking system and that is why we are struggling with the waste of time and fuel problem, when we need to park our car, we need to park our car, which requires a good amount of lighting. Another issue is the chaos that occurs when parking because there is no special system. Anyone can park anywhere that sometimes causes damage to vehicles while going out or in the parking lot. Security is also an issue. To solve these problems, we are introducing a new car parking system.an approach to help drivers under smart parking finding the right parking space efficiently and book it.
This paper proposes an automated parking system utilizing machine learning (ML) techniques to optimize parking space utilization and enhance user experience. Traditional parking systems often suffer from inefficiencies, such as congestion, difficulty finding parking spots, and inefficient space allocation. In contrast, our proposed system leverages real-time data collection from sensors placed at entry and exit points, as well as within parking spots, to continuously monitor parking availability and vehicle movements. 
Machine learning algorithms are employed to analyze this data, predict parking demand, and allocate parking spaces effectively. Through a feedback loop, the system continuously learns from user behaviors and adjusts its algorithms to adapt to changing conditions. Navigation guidance is provided to drivers, directing them to the most suitable parking spot based on factors such as proximity to their destination and parking spot size. 
Furthermore, security and safety measures are integrated into the system, ensuring the protection of vehicles and pedestrians within the parking facility. Overall, our proposed automated parking system aims to optimize space utilization, reduce congestion, and enhance user satisfaction through.
